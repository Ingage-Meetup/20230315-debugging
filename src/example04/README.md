## Problem Description

Given a String return `true` if it is Palindrome otherwise `false`. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the

console.log(palindrome("My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.")); // It should return True 
console.log(palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0")); // It should return True 
console.log(palindrome("1 eye for of 1 eye.")); //It should return False
```
